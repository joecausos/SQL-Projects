# Service Data Analysis Project with Six Sigma Methodology

This project applies Six Sgima principles to analyze  customer service-related data using SQL. By examining field returns, failures, and customer behaviors, we aim to uncover key insights that improve product quality and customer satisfaction while reducing field failures. This analysis follows the Six Sigma DMAIC framework: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control.

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to transform raww operational data into meanungful insights that guide strategic and tactical decisions. By identifying inefficiencies and recurring issues in service processes, the project aims to:
- Improve Product Quality: Detect and resolve underlying issues impacting reliability.
- Optimize Service Processes: Enhannce the efficiency of service workflows and reduce turnaround time.
- Reduce Unnecessary Field Return: Pinpoint and address cases of "Unverified Issue Cases (UIC) and External Impact Case (EIC).
- Enhance Customer Satisfaction" Use data-driven insights to refine customer support and warranty policies.

## Six Sigma and SQL: Why Use Them?

### Why use Six Sigma for Data Analysis?
Six sigma is a proven methodology for improving process efficiency and reducing defects. Its structures DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) approach is ideal for identifying root problem, optimizing processes, and delivering measurable results. By combining Six Sigma principles with data analysis -- can achieve: 
- Process Optimization: Identify and Eliminated inefficiencies.
- Defect Reduction: Minimize product failures and customer dissatisfaction.
- Data-Driven Decision Making: Use quantitative insights to prioritize improvements.

### Why Use SQL for Six Sigma Data Analysis?
SQL is a powerfultool for quereying and analyzing data strored in a relational databases. Here's why SQL is an excellent choice for Six Sigma projects:
- Scalability: SQL handle large datasets efficiently, which is crucial for enterprise-level data analysis.
- Flexibility: Supports a whole ride range of tasks, from basic aggregations to advanced analysis using window function, recursive queris, and complex joins.
- Real-Time Insights: Enables direct querying of live operational databases, providing real-time updates on key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Integrations: Easily intergrates with tools like PowerBi and Tableau for reporting and visualization.

### Why Not Minitab for Data Analysis?

Minitab isa a valuable statistical tool, but it has limitations compared to SQL for operational data analysis:
- Data Size: Minitab is not optimized for large-scale datasets, whereas SQL excels at largedata volumes.
- Real-Time Analysis: SQL allows live data querying,while Minitab typicall requires pre-exported datasets.
- Automation and Integration:  SQL queries can be automated and integrated into workflows and dashboards. Minitab is primarily suited for ad-hoc analysis.
- Cost: SQL is often free or included in existing database system, whereas Minitab requires licensing.

However, Minitab remains usefil for tasks like hypothesis testingm ANOBA, and control charting, complementing SQL for specific statistical needs.

## Six Sigma Framework

THis project is structured around Six Sigma;s DMAIC methodology:

1. Define: Establish objectives and identify critical metrics for quality improvement.  
2. Measure: Collect relevant data and compute key performance indicators (KPIs).  
3. Analyze: Identify patterns, root causes, and correlations in the data.  
4. Improve: Develop and propose actionable solutions to address defects and inefficiencies.  
5. Control: Implement controls, such as dashboards or monitoring systems, to sustain improvements.

## Data Analysis Scope

The project addresses the following key questions, categorized by the complexity of SQL techniques used.

### Basic SQL Analysis

1. WHat is the "Unverfied Issue Cases (UIC) rate?
2. WHat are the field failure trends over time?
3. WHat is the rate of External Impact Case (EIC)?
4. Are there repeat return for the same device based on device id?
5. What is the rate of early field failures?
6. What is the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)?
7. What is the relationship between field failure rate and customer origin?
