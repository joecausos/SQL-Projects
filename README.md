## PURPOSE

- The purpose of this repository is to showcase my SQL-based data analysis projects, where I apply PostgreSQL and the DBeaver Community IDE to extract, manipulate, and analyze real-world datasets. These projects serve as a practical demonstration of my transition from Excel-based data analysis to leveraging the full power of SQL for data querying, reporting, and insights generation.


## GOAL
- Through each project, I aim to:

	- Explore data: Perform data extraction, cleaning, and aggregation to better understand the underlying trends and patterns.

	- Analyze and interpret: Use SQL queries to derive actionable insights, identify outliers, and uncover key drivers behind the data.

	- Build SQL proficiency: Develop and demonstrate my skills in SQL query writing, including complex joins, subqueries, and aggregations.

	- Apply Lean Six Sigma principles: Identify inefficiencies, trends, and process variations in the data to make data-driven recommendations for improvement.


- This repository not only highlights my technical skills but also serves as the foundation for my career shift into data analysis and SQL-based data-driven decision-making. By working with diverse datasets, I continuously refine my ability to turn data into valuable insights.
